## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, feel free to open an issue or email me (parsec29@protonmail.com).
Please *do not* explain publicly how to exploit a vulnerability until either:
1. The vulnerability has been fixed and users have had time to update their versions of this software
    *OR*
2. The vulnerability has not been fixed in a reasonable amount of time and people need to be informed of the vulnerability.

But *still* create an issue for the vulnerability, *without disclosing the means of exploitation*. I say this to encourage transparency - after all,
how can anyone trust a developer who hides the existence of security issues? But we also cannot give malicious hackers a golden ticket to do whatever
they want. I feel like this is a good middleground.

Although I don't plan on failing to fix vulnerabilities, I included option #2 for protection of anyone who discloses vulnerabilities responsibly.
My goal isn't security by hiding the bugs, and no competent developer(s) should engage in such practice. As such, if my software is insecure people
should know exactly how insecure it is.


#### Remember: Good software stands up to scrutiny.
*If developers hide security issues, it's probably because they're not fixing them.*
